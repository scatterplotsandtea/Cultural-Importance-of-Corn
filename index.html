                <p class="major">2023 could set record prices for corn as drought and heat ravage crops in the Midwest. This is a breakdown of farming,
                landscapes, and corn as seen through The National Gallery of Art's Open Access data on GitHub.</a>.</p>

                <p>The Corn Belt, for this article defined as Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota,
                Missouri, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Kentucky, has been the stalwart of American corn production for
                generations. It holds 87% of all corn cash receipts in the United States, amounting to a whopping $62,750,736,000 in
                2021.<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/statefacts">(Credit)</a></p>
                <p>But according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-corn-crop-withers-worst-162334551.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADa6XgKdlYkvxq57xWxVUlwADWG8ve3EFojunPLicnEzOo7OP5JxdwwvbnbNO19QorGsY9byN6CR1BIjKLo8a9EM-R8G8qrhDTljuYNcBXrL6R_nZbJ7uVBlHEZoUV2AbEdxhMurd7Hz4OF2K3H1TOP6jh7q58X-UOR33UeDLxgr">Yahoo! Finance</a>, “heat and drought [in 2023] have shriveled the potential for yields in critical growing
                areas of the Midwest. The portion of the US corn crop rated good to excellent has dropped to 55%, the lowest for this
                time of year since 1992.” Economists are estimating that lower yields will give way to higher prices.</p>
                <p>As the weather plays out in the Corn Belt and beyond this summer, let’s take a look at farming in a different way.</p>
                    <h2>Farming, as viewed through The National Gallery of Art acquisitions</h2>
                    <p>The National Gallery of Art has over 150,000 artworks in its collection. The National Gallery, originally started as a
                    gift to the nation from Andrew W. Mellon, officially began in 1937 with Mellon’s own painting and sculpture collection.
                    Then in 1943, the Gallery accepted the Index of American Design, “a collection of more than 18,000 drawings and
                    watercolors documenting early American design and craftsmanship, and related research materials, from the federal Works
                    Progress Administration” (learn more <a href="https://www.nga.gov/research/gallery-archives/nga-history-timeline.html">here</a>). The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <span class="image fit">
                    <img src="Graph_The National Gallery accessioned over 27k artworks in 1943.png" alt="Time trend graph showing that The National Gallery accessioned over 27K artworks in 1943." />

            <div class="inner">
                <p>Looking through the data from The National Gallery's <a href="https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/opendata">GitHub</a>, the results are surprising. In an age of modern art, it seems the allure of a calming landscape and a desire to get back to our agricultural roots is at its peak.</p>
                <iframe
                    title="11% of 2010s acquisitions were landscapes making it the highest decade for landscape acquisitions by more than 200%"
                    aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-e3WKr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/e3WKr/1/" scrolling="no"
                    frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="426" data-external="1"></iframe>
                <script type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", (function (a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var e = document.querySelectorAll("iframe"); for (var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var r = 0; r < e.length; r++)if (e[r].contentWindow === a.source) { var i = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px"; e[r].style.height = i } } })) }();
                </script>
                <p>Nearly 30% of all rural or farm landscapes were acquired in 2015. In fact, breaking down The National Gallery’s
                acquisition data by year according to keyword shows that 58% of all rural/farm acquisitions occurred in 2010 or later.</p>
                <p>If these results are surprising to you, you’re not alone. As time passes, and data entry adjusts, what is classified as
                a ‘landscape’ may change. Taking a closer look at the collections data reveals that 8% of artworks aren’t tagged with
                any keywords and at least 10,000 artworks aren’t included in the dataset. And over half (53%) of the artworks that are
                recorded aren’t assigned a theme, such as landscape or still life.</p>
                <p>Do we just have more detailed recordkeeping today, or could it be that as the climate changes, we value our “amber waves
                of grain” more as we recognize their fragile nature? My guess is that it’s a little bit of both.</p>
